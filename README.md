# Chemotaxis Simulation

An agent-based model of biological chemotaxis driven movement implemented with Unity3D. 

## Roadmap

* simple 3d environment [X]
* dumb agent [X]
* dumb agent with states and random movement [X]
* autonomous agent with finite state machine and logical movement [X]
  * expected completion date: 19/11/15
* goal driven agent that simulates chemotaxis convincingly [current]
  * Markov Decision Process
    * Break behaviour into discrete actions [ ]
    * Map world points as States [ ]
    * Find a Reward algorithm that's based on sugar concentration in current state and the neighbour states [ ]
    * Agent implements MDP with a given policy [ ]
    * Have Agent new novel policies [ ]
  * expected completion date: 14/02/16
* machine learning agent that can autonomously derive new tactics [ ]
  * expected completion date: 01/03/16
