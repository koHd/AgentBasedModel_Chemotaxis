# Chemotaxis Simulation

An agent-based model of biological chemotaxis driven movement. 

## Roadmap

* simple 3d environment [X]
* dumb agent [X]
* dumb agent with states and random movement [X]
* autonomous agent with finite state machine and logical movement [current]
** expected completion date: 19/11/15
* goal driven agent that simulates chemotaxis convincingly [ ]
** expected completion date: 03/12/15
* machine learning agent that can autonomously derive new tactics [ ]
** expected completion date: 01/02/16
